/**
 * Behavior for bhvBird. These are the birds in the castle grounds

 * are loaded by the level, and are inactive until Mario comes within
 * 2000 units of them, when they spawn 6 spawned birds and start flying.
 * Spawned birds are only spawned by a spawner bird, and start flying
 * immediately after spawning.
